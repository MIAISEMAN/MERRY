#### The Dataset
For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging. The dataset can be found in the file "kc_house_data.csv", in this repo.

The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. As with most real-world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgement if you have questions relating to what the data means.

You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible.

#### The Deliverables
There will be four deliverables for this project:
